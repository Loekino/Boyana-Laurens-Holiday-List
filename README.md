# Boyana-Laurens-Holiday-List
Oi! 
Combined a codrops interactive checklist and bootstrap grid system to make myself a checklist for our holiday! 
Steal it, leach it, adjust it and use it for your own benefit in never forgetting underwears! 

Makes use of SVG animations for lists/forms/checkboxes. Very easy to use thanks to codrop clean code. 

To do: 
- Add weather widget with the holdiday dates
- Add links to useful sites (railroad, busses, food ordering, gas stations
- Add location information about where we stay, might need to make this private :D 
- Enjoy holidays!
- Menu
- make it all smaller
